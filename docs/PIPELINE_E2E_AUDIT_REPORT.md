## FASE 2: Question Analysis (MICRO Level - 300 Questions)

### Purpose
Analyze document text against 300 policy questions to extract evidence.

### Structure
- **10 Policy Areas** (P1-P10)
- **6 Dimensions per Area** (D1-D6)
- **5 Questions per Dimension** (Q1-Q5)
- **Total**: 10 × 6 × 5 = 300 questions

### Process
```python
# Concurrent processing via WorkerPool
with WorkerPool(config) as pool:
    for question in questions:
        evidence = pool.submit(
            analyze_question,
            task_id=question.base_slot,
            text=preprocessed.raw_text,
            question=question
        )
```

### Evidence Structure (per question)
```python
# Varies by scoring modality
TYPE_A: {elements: List, confidence: float}
TYPE_B: {elements: List}
TYPE_C: {elements: List, confidence: float}
TYPE_D: {elements: List, weights: List}
TYPE_E: {present: bool}
TYPE_F: {semantic_score: float}
```

### Micro-Level Structuring
```
P1 (Policy Area 1)
├── D1 (Dimension 1)
│   ├── Q1 (Question 1) → Evidence
│   ├── Q2 (Question 2) → Evidence
│   ├── Q3 (Question 3) → Evidence
│   ├── Q4 (Question 4) → Evidence
│   └── Q5 (Question 5) → Evidence
├── D2 (Dimension 2)
│   └── [5 questions...]
...

- **Error Handling**: Retries with exponential backoff

### Issues
- None found

---

## FASE 3: Scoring (MICRO Level - 300 Scored Questions)

### Purpose
Apply scoring modality to each question's evidence, producing normalized scores.

### Structure
Same 300-question structure, now with scores:
```
P1-D1-Q1 → ScoredResult(score=2.5, quality=BUENO)
P1-D1-Q2 → ScoredResult(score=1.8, quality=ACEPTABLE)
...
P10-D6-Q5 → ScoredResult(score=2.9, quality=EXCELENTE)
```

### Process
```python
for question, evidence in zip(questions, evidences):
    scored = apply_scoring(
        evidence=evidence,
        modality=question.modality,
        config=scoring_config
    )
```

### Output: ScoredResult
```python
ScoredResult {
    question_global: int (1-300)
    base_slot: str (e.g., "PA01-DIM01-Q001")
    policy_area: str (e.g., "PA01")
    dimension: str (e.g., "DIM01")
    modality: str (TYPE_A-F)
    score: float (0-3)
    normalized_score: float (0-1)
    quality_level: str (EXCELENTE/BUENO/ACEPTABLE/INSUFICIENTE)
    evidence_hash: str (SHA-256)
    metadata: Dict
    timestamp: str (ISO)
}
```

### Quality Levels (MICRO)
```
EXCELENTE:     normalized_score ≥ 0.85  (85%)
BUENO:         normalized_score ≥ 0.70  (70%)
ACEPTABLE:     normalized_score ≥ 0.55  (55%)
INSUFICIENTE:  normalized_score < 0.55  (<55%)
```

### Contract Validation
- ✅ All 300 questions scored
- ✅ Score in range [0, 3]
- ✅ Normalized score in [0, 1]
- ✅ Quality level correctly mapped
- ✅ Deterministic: same evidence → same score

### Micro-Level Reporting
Each question produces:
- Raw score (0-3)
- Normalized score (0-1)
- Quality classification
- Evidence hash (for reproducibility)

### Issues
- None found

---

## FASE 4: Dimension Aggregation (MICRO → MESO Transition)

### Purpose
Aggregate 5 question scores per dimension into 1 dimension score.

### Structure
```
300 ScoredResults → 60 DimensionScores
  10 areas × 6 dimensions = 60 dimensions
```

### Process
```python
aggregator = DimensionAggregator(monolith, abort_on_insufficient=True)

for area_id in areas:
    for dim_id in dimensions:
        # Get 5 scored results for this dimension
        scored_results = [
            sr for sr in all_scored 
            if sr.policy_area == area_id and sr.dimension == dim_id
        ]
        
        dim_score = aggregator.aggregate_dimension(
            dimension_id=dim_id,
            area_id=area_id,
            scored_results=scored_results  # 5 results
        )
```

### Output: DimensionScore
```python
DimensionScore {
    dimension_id: str
    area_id: str
    score: float (0-3)
    quality_level: str
    evidence: Dict
}
```

### Aggregation Logic
1. **Weight Validation**: Ensure weights sum to 1.0
2. **Coverage Check**: Ensure all 5 questions present
3. **Weighted Average**: score = Σ(score_i × weight_i)
4. **Threshold Application**: Map score → quality level
5. **Hermeticity**: Verify complete dimension

### Contract Validation
- ✅ 60 dimensions created (10 areas × 6 dims)
- ✅ Each dimension from exactly 5 questions
- ✅ Scores in range [0, 3]
- ✅ Quality levels correctly mapped

### Issues
- ⚠️ Monolith structure not validated at init
- ⚠️ Weight validation doesn't reject negatives

---

## FASE 5: Area Aggregation (MESO Level)

### Purpose
Aggregate 6 dimension scores per area into 1 area score.

### Structure
```
60 DimensionScores → 10 AreaScores
  10 areas × 1 score each
```

### Process
```python
aggregator = AreaPolicyAggregator(monolith, abort_on_insufficient=True)

for area_id in areas:
    # Get 6 dimension scores for this area
    dim_scores = [
        ds for ds in all_dim_scores
        if ds.area_id == area_id
    ]
    
    area_score = aggregator.aggregate_area(
        area_id=area_id,
        dimension_scores=dim_scores  # 6 scores
    )
```

### Output: AreaScore
```python
AreaScore {
    area_id: str
    score: float (0-3)
    quality_level: str
    dimension_scores: List[float]
    evidence: Dict
}
```

### Aggregation Logic
1. **Hermeticity Check**: Ensure all 6 dimensions present
2. **Score Normalization**: Normalize to [0, 1]
3. **Weighted Average**: Apply area-specific weights
4. **Threshold Application**: Map to quality level

### Contract Validation
- ✅ 10 areas created
- ✅ Each area from exactly 6 dimensions
- ✅ Scores in range [0, 3]
- ✅ Hermeticity enforced

### MESO-Level Structuring
```
10 Policy Areas:
├── PA01: Score X.XX (QUALITY_LEVEL)
├── PA02: Score X.XX (QUALITY_LEVEL)
...
└── PA10: Score X.XX (QUALITY_LEVEL)
```

### Issues
- ⚠️ Monolith structure requires `niveles.policy_areas`
- ⚠️ Not validated at initialization

---

## FASE 6: Cluster Aggregation (MESO Level - 4 Clusters)

### Purpose
Aggregate policy areas into 4 thematic clusters.

### Structure
```
10 AreaScores → 4 ClusterScores

Cluster Definition (from monolith):
CL01: Areas [PA01, PA02, PA03]
CL02: Areas [PA04, PA05, PA06]
CL03: Areas [PA07, PA08]
CL04: Areas [PA09, PA10]
```

### Process
```python
aggregator = ClusterAggregator(monolith, abort_on_insufficient=True)

for cluster_id in clusters:
    # Get area scores for this cluster
    area_scores = [
        a_score for a_score in all_area_scores
        if a_score.area_id in cluster_def[cluster_id]["areas"]
    ]
    
    cluster_score = aggregator.aggregate_cluster(
        cluster_id=cluster_id,
        area_scores=area_scores
    )
```

### Output: ClusterScore
```python
ClusterScore {
    cluster_id: str
    score: float (0-3)
    area_scores: List[float]
    coherence: float
    evidence: Dict
}
```

### Aggregation Logic
1. **Cluster Hermeticity**: Ensure all areas in cluster present
2. **Weight Application**: Cluster-specific weights
3. **Coherence Analysis**: Measure consistency across areas
4. **Threshold Application**: Map to quality level

### Contract Validation
- ✅ 4 clusters created
- ✅ Each cluster from its defined areas
- ✅ Coherence calculated
- ✅ Scores in range [0, 3]

### MESO-Level Reporting
```
4 Clusters:
├── CL01: Score X.XX (Coherence Y.YY)
├── CL02: Score X.XX (Coherence Y.YY)
├── CL03: Score X.XX (Coherence Y.YY)
└── CL04: Score X.XX (Coherence Y.YY)
```

### Issues
- ⚠️ Monolith requires `niveles.clusters`
- ⚠️ Cluster definition flexibility unclear

---

## FASE 7: Macro Evaluation (MACRO Level - Holistic)

### Purpose
Synthesize 4 cluster scores into 1 holistic evaluation of the policy plan.

### Structure
```
4 ClusterScores → 1 MacroScore
```

### Process
```python
aggregator = MacroAggregator(monolith, abort_on_insufficient=True)

macro_score = aggregator.evaluate_macro(
    cluster_scores=all_cluster_scores  # 4 scores
)
```

### Output: MacroScore
```python
MacroScore {
    score: float (0-3)
    quality_level: str
    cluster_scores: List[float]
    cross_cutting_coherence: float
    systemic_gaps: List[str]
    strategic_alignment: float
    evidence: Dict
}
```

### Aggregation Logic
1. **Cross-Cutting Coherence**: Measure inter-cluster consistency
2. **Systemic Gap Identification**: Detect weak clusters
3. **Strategic Alignment**: Assess overall plan coherence
4. **Final Score**: Weighted combination
5. **Threshold Application**: Map to holistic quality level

### Contract Validation
- ✅ 1 macro score created
- ✅ Incorporates all 4 clusters
- ✅ Coherence and alignment calculated
- ✅ Score in range [0, 3]

### MACRO-Level Reporting
```
Holistic Plan Evaluation:
├── Overall Score: X.XX (QUALITY_LEVEL)
├── Cross-Cutting Coherence: Y.YY
├── Strategic Alignment: Z.ZZ
├── Systemic Gaps: [list]
└── Cluster Breakdown: [CL01, CL02, CL03, CL04]
```

### Issues
- None found

## Phase Transitions Analysis

### MICRO → MESO Transition (FASE 3 → FASE 4)
```
300 Questions → 60 Dimensions
Reduction: 5:1 ratio
Mechanism: DimensionAggregator
```
✅ **Well-defined**: Each 5 questions explicitly aggregate to 1 dimension

### MESO → MESO Transitions
```
FASE 4 → FASE 5:  60 Dimensions → 10 Areas (6:1 ratio)
FASE 5 → FASE 6:  10 Areas → 4 Clusters (varies by cluster)
```
✅ **Well-defined**: Hierarchical structure maintained

### MESO → MACRO Transition (FASE 6 → FASE 7)
```
4 Clusters → 1 Holistic Score
Reduction: 4:1 ratio
Mechanism: MacroAggregator
```
✅ **Well-defined**: All clusters contribute to macro

---

## Data Flow Integrity

### Traceability
Each level maintains links to lower levels:
- DimensionScore → references 5 ScoredResults (via evidence)
- AreaScore → references 6 DimensionScores
- ClusterScore → references AreaScores
- MacroScore → references 4 ClusterScores

✅ **Full traceability** from macro score down to individual questions

### Reproducibility
- ✅ Seed propagated through all phases
- ✅ Evidence hashes at every level
- ✅ Deterministic aggregation
- ✅ Timestamps for audit trail

### Error Propagation
```
Question Analysis Error
    → Missing evidence
    → Insufficient scoring
    → Abort flag in dimension aggregation
    → Propagates to area aggregation
    → Can abort entire pipeline
```

✅ **Abort mechanism** allows graceful failure at any phase
