## Pipeline Architecture Summary

### MICRO Level (300 Questions)
```
Structure: 10 Policy Areas × 6 Dimensions × 5 Questions = 300

Example:
PA01 (Education)
  ├── DIM01 (Access) → Q001, Q002, Q003, Q004, Q005
  ├── DIM02 (Quality) → Q006, Q007, Q008, Q009, Q010
  ├── DIM03 (Equity) → Q011, Q012, Q013, Q014, Q015
  ├── DIM04 (Efficiency) → Q016, Q017, Q018, Q019, Q020
  ├── DIM05 (Sustainability) → Q021, Q022, Q023, Q024, Q025
  └── DIM06 (Innovation) → Q026, Q027, Q028, Q029, Q030

Each question:
  - Evidence extracted
  - Scored (0-3) via modality (TYPE_A-F)
  - Quality level assigned (EXCELENTE/BUENO/ACEPTABLE/INSUFICIENTE)
  - SHA-256 hash for reproducibility
```

### MESO Level (4 Clusters)
```
Structure: 60 Dimensions → 10 Areas → 4 Clusters

FASE 4: 300 Questions → 60 Dimensions (5:1 reduction)
FASE 5: 60 Dimensions → 10 Areas (6:1 reduction)
FASE 6: 10 Areas → 4 Clusters (varies by cluster)

Cluster Example:
CL01 (Social Development)
  ├── PA01 (Education) → 6 dimensions
  ├── PA02 (Health) → 6 dimensions
  └── PA03 (Housing) → 6 dimensions
  
Each cluster:
  - Coherence score (consistency across areas)
  - Weighted aggregation
  - Quality level
```

### MACRO Level (Holistic)
```
Structure: 4 Clusters → 1 Holistic Evaluation

FASE 7: 4 Clusters → 1 MacroScore

MacroScore includes:
  - Overall score (0-3)
  - Cross-cutting coherence
  - Systemic gaps identification
  - Strategic alignment
  - Quality level
  
Provides:
  - Executive summary
  - Strategic prioritization
  - Resource allocation guidance
```

## Security Analysis

**CodeQL Scan Result**: ✅ 0 alerts

- No security vulnerabilities detected
- Code follows secure coding practices
- Input validation properly implemented
- No injection vulnerabilities
- No sensitive data exposure

---

## Testing Philosophy

### Preconditions (Input Validation)
```python
# Example from scoring module
def score_type_a(evidence: Dict, config: ModalityConfig):
    # Precondition: evidence must be dict with required keys
    validate_contract(evidence, dict, parameter="evidence", ...)
    validate_mapping_keys(evidence, ["elements", "confidence"], ...)
```

### Postconditions (Output Validation)
```python
# Example from aggregation module
def aggregate_dimension(...) -> DimensionScore:
    result = DimensionScore(...)
    # Postcondition: score in valid range
    assert 0.0 <= result.score <= 3.0
    return result
```

### Invariants (State Consistency)
```python
# Example from concurrency module
class WorkerPool:
    # Invariant: max_workers constraint always enforced
    assert len(self.active_workers) <= self.config.max_workers
```
