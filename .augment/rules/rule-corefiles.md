# SAAAAAA – AI Design Principles and Refactoring Rules

## Core File Utilization Rule (NEW)

**Rule 11.1: Core File Sufficiency and Maximum Potentiation**

- The following files are declared as the **core arsenal** of the project:
  - `dereck_beach.py`
  - `contradiction_deteccion.py`
  - `Analyzer_one.py`
  - `policy_processor.py`
  - `semantic_chunking_policy.py`
  - `teoria_cambio.py`
  - `financiero_viabilidad_tablas.py`
  - `embedding_policy.py`

- **These files contain all the necessary classes, methods, and functions required for the full execution of plan analysis.**
- **Do NOT create additional functions or methods duplicating, overlapping, or superseding functionality within this realm.**
- **All new analysis, refactoring, pipeline orchestration, or integration must maximize the use and potentiality of these files.**
- When designing or refactoring, always:
  - Reference the existing class/method in the appropriate file.
  - Prefer extending, configuring, or orchestrating these core modules (never replicating their logic elsewhere).
  - Consult the provided schema of each file to understand its individual structure and leverage its full capability.
  - Integrate new features by composing or chaining the core classes/functions—not by adding redundant analytical routines.
  - If a needed function exists in a core file, always use it rather than reimplementing.
- **No additional analytical functions should be created in other files unless they are strictly for orchestration, configuration, or interface purposes.**

- *Failure to comply with this rule will result in architectural drift, redundancy, and loss of maintainability. Audits must verify that all analytical code remains centralized in the designated core files.*

**Summary:**  
*The analytical power of SAAAAAA resides fully in the designated core files. The AI and developers must maximize their use, never duplicate their logic, and always orchestrate new analysis via the existing arsenal. All architectural, orchestration, and interface layers must respect this boundary.*
