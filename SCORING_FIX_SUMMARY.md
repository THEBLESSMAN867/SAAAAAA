# Score-to-Rubric Assignment Bug Fix - Summary

## Problem Statement

The system was generating high numerical scores (e.g., 2.85/3.0 = 95%) but incorrectly assigning the lowest qualitative rubric ("INSUFICIENTE" = 40-54%). This contradiction made the final output nonsensical.

### Example of the Bug
```
Log Evidence:
Score: 2.85/3.0 (raw: 0.95)
Rubric: INSUFICIENTE  ← WRONG! Should be EXCELENTE
```

## Root Cause

The original implementation used dictionary iteration with range checking:

```python
# PROBLEMATIC CODE (BEFORE)
for level, (min_score, max_score) in self.question_rubric.items():
    if min_score <= score <= max_score:
        return level
return "INSUFICIENTE"
```

This pattern was fragile because:
1. If tuples were accidentally reversed (max, min), all range checks would fail
2. Less explicit than threshold-based comparisons  
3. When no match was found, it defaulted to "INSUFICIENTE"

## Solution

Replaced with explicit >= comparisons from highest to lowest threshold (as recommended in the issue):

```python
# FIXED CODE (AFTER)
if score >= 2.55:  # 85% of 3.0
    return "EXCELENTE"
elif score >= 2.10:  # 70% of 3.0
    return "BUENO"
elif score >= 1.65:  # 55% of 3.0
    return "ACEPTABLE"
else:  # Below 55%
    return "INSUFICIENTE"
```

## Changes Made

### 1. report_assembly.py

#### Fixed `_score_to_qualitative_question` (line 920)
- Replaced dictionary iteration with explicit >= comparisons
- Uses standardized thresholds: 2.55, 2.10, 1.65 (85%, 70%, 55% of 3.0)

#### Fixed `_classify_plan` (line 1857)
- Applied same pattern to macro-level (0-100%) rubric assignment
- Uses standardized thresholds: 85, 70, 55, 40 (percentages)

### 2. policy_analysis_pipeline.py

#### Standardized thresholds (line 1344)
- **Before:** Used inconsistent thresholds (2.5, 2.0, 1.5)
- **After:** Uses standard thresholds (2.55, 2.10, 1.65) matching report_assembly.py

### 3. Test Suite

Added comprehensive tests to prevent regression:
- **tests/test_scoring_rubric_fix.py**: 30 test cases covering all boundaries
- **tests/test_scoring_integration.py**: Integration tests for consistency

## Standardized Thresholds

All modules now use consistent thresholds:

### Question-level (0-3 scale)
| Rubric        | Threshold | Percentage |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| EXCELENTE     | ≥ 2.55    | 85%        |
| BUENO         | ≥ 2.10    | 70%        |
| ACEPTABLE     | ≥ 1.65    | 55%        |
| INSUFICIENTE  | < 1.65    | < 55%      |

### Macro-level (0-100% scale)
| Rubric        | Threshold |
|---------------|-----------|
| EXCELENTE     | ≥ 85%     |
| BUENO         | ≥ 70%     |
| SATISFACTORIO | ≥ 55%     |
| INSUFICIENTE  | ≥ 40%     |
| DEFICIENTE    | < 40%     |

## Test Results

All tests pass successfully:

```
✓ ALL TESTS PASSED - BUG IS FIXED!

Basic Tests (test_scoring_rubric_fix.py):
  ✓ Critical bug case: Score 2.85/3.0 (95%) → EXCELENTE ✓
  ✓ Question-level mapping: 15/15 passed
  ✓ Macro-level mapping: 15/15 passed

Integration Tests (test_scoring_integration.py):
  ✓ Threshold consistency: PASS
  ✓ Edge cases: 9/9 passed  
  ✓ Macro-level consistency: 8/8 passed
```

## Verification

To verify the fix works:

```bash
# Run basic tests
python3 tests/test_scoring_rubric_fix.py

# Run integration tests
python3 tests/test_scoring_integration.py
```

Expected output: All tests should pass with the critical bug case showing:
```
Score: 2.85/3.0 (95.0%)
Result: EXCELENTE
Status: ✓ FIXED
```

## Impact

This fix ensures that:
1. High scores correctly map to high rubrics
2. The system provides sensible, non-contradictory outputs
3. All scoring modules use consistent thresholds
4. The fix is well-tested and regression-proof

## Files Modified

- `report_assembly.py` - Fixed both question and macro-level rubric assignment
- `policy_analysis_pipeline.py` - Standardized thresholds
- `tests/test_scoring_rubric_fix.py` - New test suite
- `tests/test_scoring_integration.py` - New integration tests
